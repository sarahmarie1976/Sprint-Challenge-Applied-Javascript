1. What is the DOM?

The DOM stands for "Document Object Model". The DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. 

The DOM is an Application Programming Interface ("API") provided by the BROWSER, not Javascript. It acts as a bridge between the browser and code. 

It is an interface that allows a programming language (like JS) to manipulate the content, structure, and style on a webpage. We'll use the DOM to:

- Add content
- Delete content
- Change content


2. What is an event?

Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the stystem tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. 


3. What is an event listener?

The eventlistener is a built in function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second arguement to be called whenever the described event gets fired. 



4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

NodeLists and Arrays are two different things because NodeLists are actually not a JavaScript API, but a browser API.

A NodeList is static, where any changes in the DOM does not affect the content of the collection. 



5. What is a component?

A component is a small, potentially re-usable set of logic, behaviors and interface elements (UI or API). 

Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.
